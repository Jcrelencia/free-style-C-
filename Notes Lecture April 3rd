Thursday april 3rd lecture notes
1)If code complies on computer but not github then the student hasn't commited correctly to the github.
2)The way we structure the code doesnt matter as long it is consistent.
3)Github is a like a time machine. When you want to change something in the main code but you don't wanna mess it up, you create a new branch
4)Always remember to commit and push whenver finishing an assignment, the new stuff that hasn't been commited will havea color next to the text line
5)Clion has functions to make classes, constructors, etc..
6) Test cases are very important in this class as it showes the instructor that the student knows the code works rather than having github show you its correct
7)dont but obious comments over lines of code.
8)using the debugger module is very useful to going step through step on what your code is doing
